//! Top-level TUI application: state, key routing, and the async event loop.
//!
//! Key routing precedence (pinned in DECISIONS.md):
//! 1. An open overlay (search/palette) consumes every key.
//! 2. Request pane focused with edtui in a non-Normal mode (insert/visual/…):
//!    all keys go to edtui — except a CONTROL-modified key that the keymap
//!    resolves to Send or Quit, which is dispatched instead (the single
//!    documented exception: Ctrl-S/Ctrl-C are not text-input keys, and the
//!    lookup goes through the keymap so user remaps are honoured).
//! 3. Otherwise the crokey keymap is consulted first; unmapped keys fall
//!    through to edtui when the request pane is focused.
